Targeted marketing activities to specific groups

Business Case
Data Preparation
Segmentation with K-means Clustering
Hyperparameter Tuning
Visualization and Interpretation of the Results
Along the way, I will explain how K-means clustering works. Eventually, I will provide specific strategies for the segments formed.
